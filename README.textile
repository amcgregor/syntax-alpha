h2. Syntax

bq. Syntax highlighting source code viewer for iOS devices.

Currently this application is not designed for independant use; other applications (like Safari) call this application by using the @source://@ and @source-s://@ protocols.

For convienence, you can bookmark <a href="javascript:(function(){window.location=window.location.href.replace('https://','source-s://').replace('http://','source://');})()">this bookmarklet</a> in Safari, which can then be synchronized to your phone.

h3. Features

* Syntax highlighting of a wide range of languages.
* Callable by any application on any iOS device by calling a protocol handler.

h3. The Future

I have many, many plans for this application.  All of them are outlined on the "issue list":http://github.com/GothAlice/Syntax/issues.
