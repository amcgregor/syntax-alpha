    Welcome to Syntax, the syntax highlighting source code viewer.
    
    This application is intended to be launched from other
    applications, such as Safari, not used directly.  What you are
    currently viewing is the source code for the viewer itself; how meta!
    
    Adding a bookmarklet to Safari to allow you to view the source of
    any page currently displayed is easy; bookmark any page (the shorter
    the URL, the easier to replace), then find and modify the bookmark.
    Change the address to the following:
        
        javascript:(function(){window.location=window.location.href.replace('https://','source-s://').replace('http://','source://');})()
        
    Other applications in the system can open this one by launching any URL
    beginning in source:// or source-s://.  The resulting page will be
    downloaded via HTTP or HTTPS, respectively, then viewed in full color!
        
    The folowing languages are currenty supported and detected based on
    filename extension:
        
     - C, C++, C#
     - CSS
     - diff, patch
